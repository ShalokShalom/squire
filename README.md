I originally wanted to have "Knight" and "Squire" languages---the Knight would be simpler, and Squire would be more complex. However, I decided against it, as I like the purity of just Knight. 

So instead I decided to write this in one weekend. It turned out to be a fun project, but i never intended it to be anything. So I just keep adding to it without ever going back to refactor.

Possible additions:
- Static fields on `form`s
- Inheritence for `form`s
- macros
- pattern matching
- varidict functions and keyword parameters
- modules
- dictionaries
- interpolation
- pattern matching on functions
