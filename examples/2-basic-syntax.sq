# Naturally, Squire uses Roman Numerals for numbers.
six = VI;
fourteen = XIV;
proclaim("eighty four is: \(six * fourteen)\n"); #=> eighty four: is LXXXIV

# Just for sanity's sake, squire also supports zero and negative Roman Numerals.
proclaim("0=\(I-I), -1=\(II-I)") #=> 0=N, -1=-I

# If you wish to use arabic numerals, use the `arabic` function:
proclaim("eighty four is: \(arabic(six * fourteen))\n"); #=> eighty four is: 84
proclaim("2+4=\(arabic(2+4))\n"); #=> 2+4=6


# Mr Boole was not alive in the middle ages. As such, we do not have "Booleans,"
# but instead have Veracity---the truthiness of something.
truth = yay;
falsehood = nay;
proclaim("is truth false? \(truth == falsehood)\n"); #=> is truth false? nay


# As an homage to the Knights of Ni, we use `ni` for nonexistent values:
proclaim("the knights of \(ni)!\n"); #=> the knights of ni!


# Quoted string literals don't have anything special---they support hex escapes,
# and most normal backslash escapes (eg `\t`). Interpolation is done via `\(`.
# Single quoted strings will only only interpret `\\` escapes for `'`, `"`, and
# `\` itself.
squire = "squire";
proclaim("What is cool? \(squire)!\n"); #=> What is cool? squire!\n
proclaim('What is cool? \(squire)!\n'); #=> What is cool? \(squire)!\n

# Squire also has *bare words*. However, they must be written in Fraktur unicode
# characters exclusively, which will be converted to their ASCII equivalents.
# Multiple words may be separated with whitespace, however leading and trailing
# whitespace will be stripped. 
squire = 𝔰𝔮𝔲𝔦𝔯𝔢 𝔦𝔰 𝔠𝔬𝔬𝔩;
proclaim("What is cool? \(squire)!\n"); #=> What is cool? squire is cool!
