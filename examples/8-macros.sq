# What runtime language would be complete with macros? Squire has a few simple
# macros available. All macro invocations start with `@` (eg `@henceforth`), and
# must end with a `;`.


# `@compile` is used to import other files into this one and compile them.
# (sort of a watered-down version of C's `#include`)
@compile "1-hello-world.sq"; # "Hello world!"

# `@henceforth` is used for text replacement at compile time. There's two versi-
# ons--normal and functional. Both versions are terminated by a trailing `;`,
# unlike C's `#define`. Note that you can escape `;`s in the macro text via the
# `<< ... >>` constructs. Note that all variables relating to macros must be
# prefixed with a `$` to denote that they're macro variables.
